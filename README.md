# Dark IDLE Theme
A dark theme created for Python's built in IDE, IDLE, that has a similar color palette to Monokai, but has colors that are easier on the eyes and more visible and a red highlight for errors.

<b>To install this on Windows 10</b>, go to "C:\Users\(username goes here)\.idlerc" and paste the config_main and config_highlight files here. Then, open the IDLE shell and, under the "Options" toolbar, open "Configure IDLE" and click on the "Highlights" tab. Select the "dark_theme" option and click Apply. This sets the theme to the dark theme unless changed back to the default theme.
